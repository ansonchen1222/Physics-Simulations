# Science Simulations

A collection of interactive science simulations for education.  
These simulations were originally conceptualized by a group of science teachers in Hong Kong and developed with the assistance of AI models.  
Our goal is to create an open platform where teachers can easily build, customize, and share science simulations for classroom use.


## Structure

Simulations are organized by subject:

*   **Biology**
*   **Chemistry**
*   **Physics**

The project originally began as a physics simulations collection, so physics includes several topic-based subfolders. As biology and chemistry expand, they can also adopt similar organization.


## Usage

Here is our production website:
https://ai-science-sims.github.io/science-simulations/

If you pull the repo and want to test it, 
you can do so by running `python3 -m http.server` in the root folder,
then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions from other science teachers!

*   **Found an issue?** Please [open an Issue](https://github.com/ai-science-sims/science-simulations/issues) to report bugs or suggest improvements.
*   **Want to collaborate?** If you have a simulation to share or want to help improve existing ones, feel free to submit a Pull Request, contact us via the Issues tab, or reach out directly if you already collaborate with us through teacher networks (e.g., WhatsApp).
